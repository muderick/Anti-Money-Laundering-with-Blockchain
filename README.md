# Anti-Money-Laundering-with-Blockchain
It's difficult to understand blockchain. It wasn't, at least not for me. Due to the dearth of functional examples of how this technology functions, I had to deal with a lot of disappointments. And since I enjoy learning via doing, if you follow my instructions, you will eventually have a working Blockchain and a clear understanding of how they operate.

### What is required...

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Delete the ```database``` file first before running the program

Use ```SQLite``` for database monitoring

Use ```bchain.py``` file to build the entire structure of blockchain functions

Open ```bfunctions.py``` file the flask integration to the other python files and the templates

In this project you dont need to use any HTTP client like Postman or Curl

I used [Bootstrap5](getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0) for styling the templates

Template format is in [Django Template Language DLT](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/templates/language/)  

Download the ```default.png``` file file ```Blockchain>static>profile_pics``` since its the startup image from the database
